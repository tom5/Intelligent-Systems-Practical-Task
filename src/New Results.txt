These are the previous results on the small Romania map, with the new A Star search results included:

Total nodes used
----------------

         Graph        Tree
BFS      1083         75973
DFS      75973    (doesn't finish)
ID                    41636
AS        180          341

Max nodes in frontier	
----------------

         Graph        Tree
BFS       210         44217
DFS      44217    (doesn't finish)
ID     NA - there is no frontier to ask.
AS         97          218

The results for npuzzle are similar.

The A* search can solve the tour for the large romania map, but I have not included this in the results since
it cannot be compared to anything.

In conclusion, the A* search with this heuristic drastically decreases the amount of time and memory that
it takes to solve these search problems, and since these solutions are also optimal, it seems like the best
type of search to use.
