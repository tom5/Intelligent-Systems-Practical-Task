On the small Romania map, the results were as follows:

Total nodes used
----------------

         Graph        Tree
BFS      1083         75973
DFS      75973    (doesn't finish)
ID                    41636


Max nodes in frontier	
----------------

         Graph        Tree
BFS       210         44217
DFS      44217    (doesn't finish)
ID                NA - there is no frontier to ask.


The results for the npuzzle task are similar.


From this I can conclude that while the running time might
be slower for a graph search, especially if equals is an expensive
operation, the cost in memory for tree searches is very expensive, 
making it much less effective for this task.
In addition, the presented solutions for tree searches is often not
very optimal.

I would have expected the DFS to cost less in memory, but this is clearly not
the case because of the huge increase in the complexity of the first solution found,
and the amount of state space it is required to search.
